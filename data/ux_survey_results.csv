Conceptually it might be very useful to highlight the bias in situ. However the AI marks numerous quotes in the text as biased giving the article an overall biased appearance which might not reflect the actual bias.","This is a great concept!","3","Very concise","","Friend or colleague not related to the group","Keep up the good work! You are on the right track.",""
"2023/03/04 9:50:56 PM OEZ","","5","Not very much, the article was very unbiased in it's writing ( probably not in the context it used) and so it was quite clear when the Ai was saying biased that this was an incorrect response.","Fine.","They are a good way to do this.","I don't think such broad labels are very worthwhile.","2","It's a bit bland.","The tips were not always in line with where they should be.","Instagram","",""

If you’re talking about the article breakdown, I liked it, though it is a bit confusing to see the gauge point rather close to the end and then have it say medium bias.","6","Easy and accessible ","The character limit for exhaling my judgment irritated me,  but I did not encounter any problems.","Friend or colleague not related to the group","Maybe it would be interesting to add, that direct quotes are more likely to be biased, while not necessarily reflecting the opinions of the authors?",""

Would rather discuss with peers, though I get it is a necessary step.","Easy visual, not too aggressive. Overall good visual. Did not distract from reading too much","","5","Look is sleek and appropriate for a modern website.","Feedback window on mobile has multiple ""steps"" no idea why","WhatsApp/Telegram","",""
