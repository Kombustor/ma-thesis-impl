        <h2>Quality Criteria</h2>
        <p>
          Our rating consists of the 3 quality criteria listed below and allows
          for easy classification. If an article passes all 3, it receives the
          &quot;reliable&quot; rating. If it passes 2/3, it receives the
          &quot;questionable&quot; ranting. If it passes only 1 or 0, it
          receives the &quot;unreliable&quot; rating.

          detects bias on the sentence level. If the total amount of biased
          sentences is under 10%, an article is &quot;low bias&quot; and passes
          the quality criterion. 10%-30% is &quot;medium bias&quot; and over 30%
          is &quot;high bias&quot;, both failing the quality criterion.
